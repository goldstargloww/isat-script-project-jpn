<h1 id="req">Required questions</h1>

<h2 id="goal">"What's your goal?"</h2>
<p>This belongs to the set of three intro questions.</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Oh...... My goal...?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (disappointed1):</b> Sif... Does it matter?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (angry1):</b> It doesn't!!! Your reasons don't matter at all!!!</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>Asking for the first time:</b><br> <b>Siffrin (fight3):</b> (But they might!)</li>
    <li><b>Asking subsequent times:</b><br> <b>Siffrin (tired1):</b> (...)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "Why do you want to freeze Vaugarde in time?"</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Siffrin...?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Oooh, oooooooh...!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Can't you guess......? Can't you tell?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Oh, stars...... I thought my intentions were clear...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (fight1):</b> We don't know! We don't understand you!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (fight4):</b> Why would you want to make an entire country suffer And expect everyone to be okay with it!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> There must be a reason!!! Why would you freeze Vaugarde in time!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> And only Vaugarde, for that matter?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry1):</b> That's true... No other country has been attacked.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry2):</b> With a power like yours, you could freeze more than just Vaugarde.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (disappointed1):</b> But you stopped at the borders. Other countries are safe.  Why?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Oooh, ooooooh......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Because...... Vaugarde......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Is perfect.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Perfect...?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Such welcoming, creative people.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Always willing to welcome travelers in, even travelers with no name, no home to speak of......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Such...... Precious memories......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> It is perfect. I do not want it to change. I want it to stay exactly how it is.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> So it cannot ever be destroyed.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk2):</b> That's so...</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot3):</b> What backwards thinking.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (fight1):</b> I don't know what about Vaugarde made it perfect for you, but you cannot stop us from living!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>

<br>

<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<h2 id="trapped">"Are you the one doing this to me?</h2>
<p>This belongs to the set of three intro questions</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Oh, oooooh...... "Doing this"......?</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>Asking for the first time:</b>
    (Stars, you don't want to explain it in front of everyone...)<br>
    (But the King... He could be the one trapping you in time!)<br> <b>Siffrin (shit1):</b> "The one imprisoning me here."</li>
    <li><b>Asking subsequent times:</b><br> (...)<br> <b>Siffrin (tired1):</b> "The one imprisoning me here."</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>Odile (worried2):</b> Imprisoning you...?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......Whatever is happening to you, I am not the one responsible, bright one.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> But...... That scent around you, could it be......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> It does not matter.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Asking for the first time:</b></p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>(He doesn't seem to know what you're talking about.)</p>
<p>(So the King isn't the one responsible for the loops?)</p>
<p>(...Isn't that weird?)</p>
<p>(You're looping through time, he's freezing it...)</p>
<p>(Aren't you using the same power?)</p>
<p>(Power over time?)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Asking subsequent times:</b></p>
<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<h2 id="how">"How are you freezing people in time?"</h2>
<p>This belongs to the set of three intro questions.</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> ......Ha.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> Pst, Sif, could've told you that one if you asked.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm2):</b> It's Time Craft, buddy.</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>If you haven't heard about Time Craft before:</b><br> (...You don't know what that is.)</li>
    <li><b>If you've heard about Time Craft:</b><br> (Time Craft, you've heard this before...)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> Time Craft... The ability to craft time itself.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> But Time Craft is supposed to be impossible to control...</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> How can you use it, yet alone do it as such a grand scale?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Ha...... If the bright one isn't bright enough to know of Time Craft......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> They will not be bright enough to understand how.</p>

<br>

<p>(Ouch.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (no!1):</b> Don't be mean to Frin!!! Shut up!!!

<br>

<p><b>Asking for the first time:</b></p>
<p>(Time Craft...)</p>
<p>(That's something to look into, isn't it?)</p>
<p>(Either way... It doesn't seem like he's the one trapping you here.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>If you have not talked to the Head Housemaiden in ACT 3:</b></p>
<p>(...Since you're here, it might be worth it to beat the King now, so you can go talk to the Head Housemaiden...)</p>
<p>(She said something before. About how you're looping. About something being broken.)</p>
<p>(She knew something!)</p>
<p>(After that, you have to find more information about Time Craft somewhere.)</p>
<p>(And you can always go back and fight the King if you have anything else to talk about.)</p>

<p><b>If you have talked to the Head Housemaiden in ACT 3:</b></p>
<p>(...You have to find more information about Time Craft somewhere.)</p>
<p>(And you can always go back and fight the King if you have anything else to talk about.)</p>

<p><b>If you've asked this question before:</b></p>
<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<h2 id="timecraft">"So, you're using Time Craft?"</h2>
<p>This question can be asked after rereading the Craftology book in the candle dorm on Floor 1.</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Time Craft......? I suppose I am.</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> But, if you're using Time Craft... How did you manage to control it?</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> Time Craft should use immeasurable amounts of power that no mere human could have... So how...</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Ha......!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Yes, it is true...... I could not have harvested Time Craft on my own.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> So...... I had some help.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> Help? Who would...?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Ooooh, ooooooh...... Isn't it obvious?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> The Universe would.</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time:</b> (!)</li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times:</b> (...)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Ah, aaaaaah! I only had to wish for it......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> And the Universe delivered.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward2):</b> "The Universe"...? Who is that? A person?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry2):</b> Nah, it's, it's...</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (boo1):</b> Wow, it's on the tip of my tongue, but I can't seem to remember.</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> It's... What's beyond this plane, correct? What's in the sky?</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time:</b> (You clench your fists.)</li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times:</b> (You do not react.)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>(The King sobs.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Oooh, oooooooh......!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Aaaah!!! I knew Vaugardians were ignorant of it...... But I did not think travelers from other countries were, too......!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> How...... How could you have......</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> "Vaugardians", huh...</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> Interesting choice of words. Are you not from Vaugarde yourself?</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious2):</b> He isn't, madame Odile... I feel like I've seen an article about it somewhere recently.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (awkward2):</b> I saw it today... Where was it again?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm2):</b> So you're not from Vaugarde, but you still want to freeze it in time?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (really3):</b> Where do you call home, then?</p>

<br>

<p>(The King flinches.)</p>
<p>(He does not answer.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>First time:</b></p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>(You shake your head, and breathe out.)</p>
<p>(An article about the King, somewhere...)</p>
<p>(If Mirabelle remembers it, you might've seen it somewhere too. Could it be somewhere in the House?)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Subsequent times:</b></p>
<p>(You do not react.)</p>

<br>

<h2 id="remember">"What should I remember?"</h2>
<p>This question can be asked after interacting with the big window inside the observatory on Floor 3.</p>
<br>

<p><b>First time:</b>
<p>(Every single time you face him...)</p>
<p>(He asks if you remember.)</p>
<p>(There's something he thinks you should know... Should remember... But...)</p>

<p><b>Subsequent times:</b></p>
<p>(You ask again, but you know, you know, you know.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> Does it really matter, Siffrin? He could just be trying to confuse you.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!1):</b> Yeah!!! Speaking in riddles to Frin!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (angry1):</b> Stop trying to confuse him! He hasn't forgotten anything!!!</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time:</b> (But you have, haven't you?)<br>(You try not to think about it, but... But...)</li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times:</b> (You know, you know, you know.)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Siffrin (hide4):</b> "What have I forgotten?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Forgotten?
<p><b>King:</b> Oh, bright one, bright one, why...... Why would you ask......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Don't you know at this point what you've forgotten? Haven't you always known?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Can't you see the hole it has left behind, if not what used to fill it?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Don't you feel it? Its absence?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fight1):</b> What the crab is he--</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ALL OF IT!!!!!! </p>
<p><b>King:</b> YOU'VE FORGOTTEN IT ALL, BRIGHT ONE!!!!!! THEY ALL HAVE!!!!!! WE ALL HAVE!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> No one can say it!!! No one can even remember it!!! It escapes us, it will keep escaping us!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Ooooh, why don't you remember?! I can tell!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Everything, from your accent, to the way you use Craft, to the stitching on your cloak and hat, to those pins you wear--</p>
<p><b>King:</b> You should remember!!! You and I, of all people standing here, should remember!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Bright one, please, please!!! Just remember it!!! Say it!!! Make it real!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Please...... If you can remember, then...... Then maybe......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>

<br>

<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> What is happening? Is he okay...?</p>
<p><b>Odile (worried1):</b> Something we've all forgotten...?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!1):</b> I haven't forgotten anything, stupid!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm4):</b> ... Sif...?</p>

<br>

<p><b>First time:</b></p>
<p>(Something you've forgotten.)</p>
<p>(Something everyone has, even if they don't pay attention to it.)</p>
<p>(The hole it has left behind.)</p>
<p>(Something bigger than just the stars.)</p>
<p>(What you're trying to remember doesn't exist anymore, but...)</p>
<p>(But someone might still have written proof it existed, haven't they?)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Subsequent times:</b></p>
<p>(You know,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>you know.)</p>

<br>

<h2 id="remember2">"Where are you from?" (Say it.)</h2>
<p><b>Source:</b> Common Event 175 (AsktheKing?) + Common Event 238 (King_Country)</p> 
<p>The non-optional version of "Where are you from?" after picking up the Sparkling Diary and looking at the mirror again. For the full event, see <a href="/acts/act3-4/kingquest.html#sayit">Kingquest</a>.</p>

<br>

<h3 id="later">(Ask later.)</h3>
<p><b>Source:</b> Common Event 175 (AsktheKing?)</p>
<p>When doing all friendquests for the first time, the option appears to ask the King on a later loop, so as not to interrupt. Because asking makes you die.</p>

<br>

<p>(...)</p>
<p>(This feels important... But you'd still like to talk to the Head Housemaiden during this loop, while you're so close to your family members.)</p>
<p>(Are you sure you want to ask the King about this now...?)</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>(No, ask him later.)</p>
<p>(You shake your head.)</p>
<p>(You can ask him later.)</p>

<br>

<h3 id="home2">"Where are you from?"</h3>


<br>

<p>(Yes, ask the King now.)</p>
<p>(You open your mouth.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "Where are you from?"</p>

<br>

<p>(Will he say it if you ask?)</p>
<p>(Can he say it?)</p>
<p>(Someone asked you this exact question before, and you couldn't answer, you couldn't say anything, you forgot it all, but... But...!!!)</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Where...... Where I'm from......?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Oooooh...... Bright one..... If you're asking, with such a look in your eye......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Do you remember, then? Can you see it? Can you picture it?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Bright one. Bright one, please, you can't...... You have to remember......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> I know you can, we both can...... We're the only ones present here who can!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> What...?</p>
<p><b>Odile (sad1):</b> Siffrin, what is he talking about?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm4):</b> Sif? Sif, are you okay?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Bright one......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> No. You're trying, I can tell. But the knowledge keeps escaping you, doesn't it...... Slipping through your fingers......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> It is the same for me.</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> But we have to try to remember, bright one!!! I see flashes of it, of what was!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> The mountains!!! The sea!!! The lightless sand, dark like the night sky!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Our country, bright one!!! Our country!!! Our home!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> We have to say it!!! We cannot let oblivion win!!! Our home!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> We can rebuild it, together!!! Your power and mine!!! We just have to wish for it!!! We just have to ask!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> WE JUST HAVE TO SAY ITS NAME!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p>An animation plays. The image of a four-pointed white star on a black background appears. Three beeps can be heard, representing the King's voice. When he finishes, the star shakes. It turns red, changing shape and forming cracks.</p>

<br>

<p>Back in battle, the screen is darker than before. Siffrin and the King take damage. Siffrin's battle portrait now looks frightened.</p>

<br>

<p>(NGH...!!!)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (uwah!1):</b> AH!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huhwah1):</b> SIF?!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> AH!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> No, no, no......</p>

<br>

<p>(...No, no, no!!!)</p>
<p>(You heard it, he said it, he tried to say it! Your country's name, your home, your--)</p>
<p>(No, no, it's gone, it's gone!!!!!!)</p>
<p>(Did he say it, all of it?! Did he say it?!?)</p>
<p>(You couldn't hear it, can't remember it, can't--)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (awawa1):</b> W-What's happening?!</p>
<p><b>Odile (fight1):</b> The King is attacking Siffrin... Everyone, protect him!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (angry1):</b> Stop talking, King!!! Leave Frin alone!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fight1):</b> Sif!!!</p>

<br>

<p>(Your head, it feels like it's splitting in two--)</p>
<p>(Your country, your home!!!)</p>
<p>(You can't remember it!!! It's gone, it's gone, it's gone!!!)</p>
<p>(gone from your past gone from your mind gone from the very planet you stand on and it was yours!!! It was yours!!!)</p>
<p>(It was yours and it's gone and you can't even say its name!!!)</p>
<p>(But if he-- If the King could, then maybe--)</p>
<p>(MAYBE...!!!)</p>

<br>

<h3 id="sayfirst">First attempt</h3>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#say1">(Say it!!!)</a></li>
    <li><a href="#dont1">(Don't!!!!)</a></li>
</ul>

<br>

<h4 id="say1">(Say it!!!)</h4>

<p>(You have to say it!!! If he couldn't do it, maybe you can! Maybe you both can!!!)</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Bright one, please, please!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p>(You inhale, you try to grasp it, grasp its name--)</p>

<br>

<p>The same animation as before repeats. A white star on a black background, this time with three lighter beeps representing Siffrin's voice. When the star turns red and shatters, the cracking noise is harsher.</p>
<p>Back in battle, Siffrin and the King take more damage than before, and the screen turns even darker.</p>

<br>

<p>(AH...!!!)</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> NO!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p>(Your throat... Your head......!!!)</p>
<p>(It hurts, it hurts...)</p>
<p>(You spit blood, you hack up, you have to get it out--)</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Bright one, I-- Almost heard it, I......!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Please, again!!! Once again, we have to try...... Together!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p>(Your entire body hurts...!!!)</p>

<br>

<h4 id="dont1">(Don't!!!)</h4>

<p>(You can't hear it, you can't remember it, it's useless!!!)</p>
<p>(Let it die, let it be forgotten! You don't need it, you don't need to know--)</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> BRIGHT ONE!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p>(No, no, no, you can't, you won't.)</p>
<p>(Hands clutching your head, you take a step back, then another.)</p>
<p>(Everyone lines up before you.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (fight1):</b> Sif, what's happening?! Talk to us!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (fight4):</b> Don't listen to the King, Siffrin!!! We'll protect you!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> BRIGHT ONE!!! SAY IT!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (fight1):</b> Don't look at him, you're fighting us right now--</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (crying1):</b> Go away!!! Stop hurting Frin!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> PLEASE!!!!!! IF WE SAY IT TOGETHER, TWO PEOPLE OF THE SAME COUNTRY, I'M SURE WE CAN--</p>
<p><b>King:</b> WE CAN REMEMBER IT!!! PLEASE!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p>(Your entire body hurts...!!!)</p>


<h3 id="saysecond">Second attempt</h3>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#say2">(SAY IT!!!)</a></li>
    <li><a href="#dont2">(DON'T!!!)</a></li>
</ul>

<br>

<h4 id="say2">(SAY IT!!!)</h4>

<p>(Your head is killing you!!!)</p>
<p>(But you have to try, you have to--)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Isabeau (scared1):</b> We have to stop the King...!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (no!1):</b> Siffrin, whatever he's telling you to say, STOP!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (crying3):</b> FRIN!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (fight4):</b> SIFFRIN!!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p>(But you have to, but you have to!!!)</p>
<p>(What do they know, anyway? What do they understand, anyway?!)</p>
<p>(The pain of not remembering your own blinding country!!! Your own home!!!)</p>
<p>(The King is right, you have to get it back, you HAVE TO GET IT BACK...!!!!!!)</p>
<p>(You inhale...)</p>

<br>

<p>The animation plays again. This time, Siffrin's and the King's voices can be heard together. The star cracks like a whip.</p>
<p>In battle, both Siffrin and the King take 9999 damage. The screen is dim, nearly black.</p>

<p>(Someone is screaming)</p>
<p>(You realize&emsp;&ensp;it's your own voice)</p>

<h1 id="optional">Optional questions</h1>

<h2 id="name">"Why call yourself King?"</h2>
<p>This question is unlocked by interacting with the Head Housemaiden's notes on the King in her room on Floor 2.</p>
<p>WIP: Add link here once room page is done.</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Oh...... Ooooooooh......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> I have...... I have decided my will is more just than the will of Vaugarde.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Vaugarde doesn't know...... No one knows that I am doing what needs to be done!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> They do not understand!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Someone who selfishly does what needs to be done, against the will of the people......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> In Vaugarde, such a person can only be called a King.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> So you know!!! You know that what you're doing is wrong, that no one wants to be frozen in time!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Against the will of the people...... Yes.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Against the will of the Universe...... No.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> It is not wrong. Our will is not wrong.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> I just want Vaugarde to stay like this. Forever. Forever. Forever......</p>

<br>

<h2 id="home">"Where are you from?"</h2>

<p>This question is unlocked by interacting with the newspaper, and can only be asked before rereading the Sparkling Diary, or else it'll trigger a <a href="/acts/act3-4/kingquest.html#sayit">special event</a>. Technically, this one's optional.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "Where are you from?"</p>
<p><b>King:</b> !!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>

<br>

<p>(The King looks straight at you.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> .....What about you, bright one......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Where are you from?</p>

<br>

<p>(You flinch.)</p>
<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<p>(You do not answer.)</p>
<p>(You cannot answer.)</p>
<p>(You hear the King laugh.)</p>

<br>

<h2 id="tall">"Why are you so tall?"</h2>
<p>This question is unlocked by interacting with the book on Body Craft in the Changing Room on Floor 3.</p>
<p>WIP note: Link here once the room page is done.</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Oh......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Quite honestly...... It just happened.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (omgggg1):</b> "IT JUST HAPPENED"?!?</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> How?!?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> After I fully accepted the power at my disposal...... I found myself like this. Towering over everyone.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> But I do not mind.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> I can see very far, in this body.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> I can even see......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> . . . . . .</p>
