<p><b>Location:</b> House of Change, last floor: the battle against the King.</p>
<p><b>Full page:</b> <a href="/rooms/king/questions.html">Questions.</a></p>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>This plays the first time you fight the King after your first victory over him, after the normal King fight intro dialogue.</p>

<br>

<p>(The King...)</p>
<p>(You finally managed to beat him last time, but you still have so many questions...)</p>
<p>(Why is he freezing Vaugarde in time? Does his power have anything to do with the time loops you're stuck in?)</p>
<p>(If you ask him something... Will he answer...?)</p>

<br>

<p>[Urgh, fine.]</p>
<p>[You can now "Ask" the King questions by going into your Craft menu!]</p>
<p>[The things I let you do, stardust, I swear.]</p>

<br>

<p><b>Subsequent times entering battle with questions:</b> (You still have questions for the King.)</p>

<br>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<h3 id="goal">"What's your goal?"</h3>

<p>This belongs to the set of three intro questions.</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Oh...... My goal...?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (disappointed1):</b> Sif... Does it matter?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (angry1):</b> It doesn't!!! Your reasons don't matter at all!!!</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>Asking for the first time:</b><br> <b>Siffrin (fight3):</b> (But they might!)</li>
    <li><b>Asking subsequent times:</b><br> <b>Siffrin (tired1):</b> (...)</li>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Siffrin...?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Oooh, oooooooh...!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Can't you guess......? Can't you tell?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Oh, stars...... I thought my intentions were clear...</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (fight1):</b> We don't know! We don't understand you!!!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (fight4):</b> Why would you want to make an entire country suffer And expect everyone to be okay with it!</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (stressed1):</b> There must be a reason!!! Why would you freeze Vaugarde in time!!!</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> And only Vaugarde, for that matter?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry1):</b> That's true... No other country has been attacked.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (angry2):</b> With a power like yours, you could freeze more than just Vaugarde.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (disappointed1):</b> But you stopped at the borders. Other countries are safe.  Why?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Oooh, ooooooh......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Because...... Vaugarde......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Is perfect.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Perfect...?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Such welcoming, creative people.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Always willing to welcome travelers in, even travelers with no name, no home to speak of......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Such...... Precious memories......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> It is perfect. I do not want it to change. I want it to stay exactly how it is.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> So it cannot ever be destroyed.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (sulk2):</b> That's so...</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot3):</b> What backwards thinking.</p>
<p><b>Mirabelle (fight1):</b> I don't know what about Vaugarde made it perfect for you, but you cannot stop us from living!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>

<br>

<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<h3 id="trapped">"Are you the one doing this to me?</h3>

<p>This belongs to the set of three intro questions</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Oh, oooooh...... "Doing this"......?</p>

<br>

<h4>Asking for the first time:</h4>
<p>(Stars, you don't want to explain it in front of everyone...)</p>
<p>(But the King... He could be the one trapping you in time!)</p> 
<p><b>Siffrin (shit1):</b> "The one imprisoning me here."</p>

<h4>Asking subsequent times:</h4> 
<p>(...)</p> 
<p><b>Siffrin (tired1):</b> "The one imprisoning me here."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>Odile (worried2):</b> Imprisoning you...?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......Whatever is happening to you, I am not the one responsible, bright one.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> But...... That scent around you, could it be......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> It does not matter.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Asking for the first time:</b></p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>(He doesn't seem to know what you're talking about.)</p>
<p>(So the King isn't the one responsible for the loops?)</p>
<p>(...Isn't that weird?)</p>
<p>(You're looping through time, he's freezing it...)</p>
<p>(Aren't you using the same power?)</p>
<p>(Power over time?)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Asking subsequent times:</b></p>
<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<h3 id="how">"How are you freezing people in time?"</h3>

<p>This belongs to the set of three intro questions.</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> ...... Ha.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hahaaa1):</b> Pst, Sif, could've told you that one if you asked.</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm2):</b> It's Time Craft, buddy.</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>If you haven't heard about Time Craft before:</b><br> (...You don't know what that is.)</li>
    <li><b>If you've heard about Time Craft:</b><br> (Time Craft, you've heard this before...)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> Time Craft... The ability to craft time itself.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> But Time Craft is supposed to be impossible to control...</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> How can you use it, yet alone do it as such a grand scale?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Ha...... If the bright one isn't bright enough to know of Time Craft......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> They will not be bright enough to understand how.</p>

<br>

<p>(Ouch.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bonnie (no!1):</b> Don't be mean to Frin!!! Shut up!!!

<br>

<p><b>Asking for the first time:</b></p>
<p>(Time Craft...)</p>
<p>(That's something to look into, isn't it?)</p>
<p>(Either way... It doesn't seem like he's the one trapping you here.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>If you have not talked to the Head Housemaiden in ACT 3:</b></p>
<p>(...Since you're here, it might be worth it to beat the King now, so you can go talk to the Head Housemaiden...)</p>
<p>(She said something before. About how you're looping. About something being broken.)</p>
<p>(She knew something!)</p>
<p>(After that, you have to find more information about Time Craft somewhere.)</p>
<p>(And you can always go back and fight the King if you have anything else to talk about.)</p>

<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> Welcome to the library! Well. Our selection is kind of lacking. All the good books are in the House. But the House is. Well. Closed until further notice. Since the King. Took residence there. And froze. Everyone in time.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> Time Craft? Like, um, specifically? I'm not sure... You should look through books about Craft. We have one here, but it might not talk about Time Craft much... I wonder... Where could you find Craftonomy books...</p>

<br>

<p>("Craftonomy"?)</p>
<p>(The librarian notices your confusion.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> Oh, the study of Craft in general is called "Craftonomy". I don't think the libraries here or in the House carry any... Maybe you should look elsewhere?</p>
<p><b>Bored Librarian:</b> ...Also, why am I thinking about candles right now? Must be nothing.</p>

        It could be used to hasten or slow people's time, too. Maybe make people's bodies younger or older. Maybe make buds grow into trees in an instant.

<p><b>Source:</b> Common Event 50</p>
<p><b>Full page:</b> <a href="/rooms/king/questions.html">Questions.</a></p>

<h2 id="home1">"Where are you from?"</h2>
<p>This question is unlocked by interacting with the newspaper, and can only be asked before rereading the Sparkling Diary, or else you're on a path to a <a href="#sayit">special event</a>. Technically, this one's optional.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin:</b> "Where are you from?"</p>
<p><b>King:</b> !!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>

<br>

<p>(The King looks straight at you.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> .....What about you, bright one......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Where are you from?</p>

<br>

<p>(You flinch.)</p>
<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<p>(You do not answer.)</p>
<p>(You cannot answer.)</p>
<p>(You hear the King laugh.)</p>

<br>

<h2 id="remember">"What should I remember?"</h2>
<p>This question can be asked after interacting with the big window inside the observatory on Floor 3.</p>

<br>

<p><b>First time:</b>
<p>(Every single time you face him...)</p>
<p>(He asks if you remember.)</p>
<p>(There's something he thinks you should know... Should remember... But...)</p>

<p><b>Subsequent times:</b></p>
<p>(You ask again, but you know, you know, you know.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>
<p><b>Odile (question1):</b> Does it really matter, Siffrin? He could just be trying to confuse you.</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!1):</b> Yeah!!! Speaking in riddles to Frin!!!</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (angry1):</b> Stop trying to confuse him! He hasn't forgotten anything!!!</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>First time:</b> (But you have, haven't you?)<br>(You try not to think about it, but... But...)</li>
    <li><b>Subsequent times:</b> (You know, you know, you know.)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (hide4):</b> "What have I forgotten?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Forgotten?
<p><b>King:</b> Oh, bright one, bright one, why...... Why would you ask......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Don't you know at this point what you've forgotten? Haven't you always known?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Can't you see the hole it has left behind, if not what used to fill it?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Don't you feel it? Its absence?</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (fight1):</b> What the crab is he--</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ALL OF IT!!!!!! </p>
<p><b>King:</b> YOU'VE FORGOTTEN IT ALL, BRIGHT ONE!!!!!! THEY ALL HAVE!!!!!! WE ALL HAVE!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> No one can say it!!! No one can even remember it!!! It escapes us, it will keep escaping us!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Ooooh, why don't you remember?! I can tell!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Everything, from your accent, to the way you use Craft, to the stitching on your cloak and hat, to those pins you wear--</p>
<p><b>King:</b> You should remember!!! You and I, of all people standing here, should remember!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Bright one, please, please!!! Just remember it!!! Say it!!! Make it real!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Please...... If you can remember, then...... Then maybe......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>

<br>

<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Mirabelle (anxious3):</b> What is happening? Is he okay...?</p>
<p><b>Odile (worried1):</b> Something we've all forgotten...?</p>
<p><b>Bonnie (no!1):</b> I haven't forgotten anything, stupid!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (hm4):</b> ...Sif...?</p>

<br>

<p><b>First time:</b></p>
<p>(Something you've forgotten.)</p>
<p>(Something everyone has, even if they don't pay attention to it.)</p>
<p>(The hole it has left behind.)</p>
<p>(Something bigger than just the stars.)</p>
<p>(What you're trying to remember doesn't exist anymore, but...)</p>
<p>(But someone might still have written proof it existed, haven't they?)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Subsequent times:</b></p>
<p>(You know,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>you know.)</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> Common Event 175 (AsktheKing?)</p>
<p>When doing all Friendquests for the first time, the option appears to ask the King on a later loop, so as not to interrupt. Because asking makes you die.</p>

<p>(Yes, ask the King now.)</p>

<br>

<p>(Will he say it if you ask?)</p>
<p>(Can he say it?)</p>
<p>(Someone asked you this exact question before, and you couldn't answer, you couldn't say anything, you forgot it all, but... But...!!!)</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> Where...... Where I'm from......?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Oooooh...... Bright one..... If you're asking, with such a look in your eye......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Do you remember, then? Can you see it? Can you picture it?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Bright one. Bright one, please, you can't...... You have to remember......</p>

<p><b>King:</b> ......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> No. You're trying, I can tell. But the knowledge keeps escaping you, doesn't it...... Slipping through your fingers......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> It is the same for me.</p>

<br>

<p><b>King:</b> But we have to try to remember, bright one!!! I see flashes of it, of what was!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> The mountains!!! The sea!!! The lightless sand, dark like the night sky!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Our country, bright one!!! Our country!!! Our home!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> We have to say it!!! We cannot let oblivion win!!! Our home!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> We can rebuild it, together!!! Your power and mine!!! We just have to wish for it!!! We just have to ask!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> WE JUST HAVE TO SAY ITS NAME!!!!!</p>

<br>

<p>An animation plays. The image of a four-pointed white star on a black background appears. Three beeps can be heard, representing the King's voice. When he finishes, the star shakes. It turns red, changing shape and forming cracks.</p>

<br>

<p>Back in battle, the screen is darker than before. Siffrin and the King take damage. Siffrin's battle portrait now looks frightened.</p>

<br>

<p>(NGH...!!!)</p>

<p><b>Mirabelle (uwah!1):</b> AH!!!</p>
<p><b>Isabeau (huhwah1):</b> SIF?!</p>

<br>

<p>(You inhale, you try to grasp it, grasp its name--)</p>

<br>

<p>The same animation as before repeats. A white star on a black background, this time with three lighter beeps representing Siffrin's voice. When the star turns red and shatters, the cracking noise is harsher.</p>
<p>Back in battle, Siffrin and the King take more damage than before, and the screen turns even darker.</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>The animation plays again. This time, Siffrin's and the King's voices can be heard together. The star cracks like a whip.</p>
<p>In battle, both Siffrin and the King take 9999 damage. The screen is dim, nearly black.</p>

<p><b>King:</b> My past, my family, my name, the language I spoke, the alphabet I wrote with, the stars, the country's inhabitants, culture, beliefs, its very name......!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> I could not remember anything!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Because all my memories, everything even slightly connected to the country I came from...... Just......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Cannot be accessed easily, anymore.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> And...... It makes sense, doesn't it?</p>
<p><b>King:</b> No one on this planet can remember our home as it was.</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Most people from outside it, who had limited ties to it, only forgot the country's existence.....</p>
<p><b>King:</b> Maybe forgot a friend from there, or a distant family member......</p>
<p><b>King:</b> But for someone who had ties to it.</p>
