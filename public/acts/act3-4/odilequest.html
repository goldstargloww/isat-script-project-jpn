        It's a book filled with tales written by a single family, through generations. It's a tradition, in Vaugarde.

        I've always wanted to read one. But, since each family has theirs, and it's something you're supposed to keep in one family and not show others...

<p>Siffrin and Odile enter the boulangerie. Odile stands by the door as Siffrin walks to the counter.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2>Talking to Odile:</h2>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot1):</b> ...</p>

<br>

<h2 id="baguette">Regular</h2>
<p>To proceed regularly, talk to Charles, the Big Boulanger.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> Hey there.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> ...Hello. We've heard you may have a familytale...?</p>
<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> A familytale?</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot3):</b> Of a family called Paperasse. If you'd be okay with it, I'd like to borrow it for a little bit...</p>
<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> Ah, the one I borrowed for my girl before the House froze.</p>
<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> I'm not a very good writer, ha... So I figured reading another one would give me some inspiration for stories to tell my little girl.</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>First time: Siffrin (questions1):</b></li>
  <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (fake1):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"Do you have it still?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> I...</p>
<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> Do not.</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> What.</p>
<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> Do you know Antoine, maybe? He lives at the east of town, in the house with no flowers, asked if he could borrow it.</p>
<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> They knew the Paperasse family, you see.</p>
<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> I couldn't really refuse. The Paperasse family died only a few years back, after all.</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> . . .</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>First time: Siffrin (okay2):</b> (Well, that sucks.)</li>
  <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (fake1):</b> (...)</li>
</ul>

<p>"Do you know if he still has it now?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> I don't see why they wouldn't.</p>
<p><b>Odile (sigh1):</b> ...I  have a sudden bad feeling about this.</p>
<p><b>Odile (wonder1):</b> The house to the east of the village, with no flowers, huh? Looks like we should go pay them a visit...</p>

<br>

<h3>Repeated interaction</h3>

<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> My friend Antoine, who lives at the east of town, in the house with no flowers, asked if he could borrow that familytale.</p>
<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> ...Good luck with the book.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="shortcut">Shortcut</h2>
<p>You can skip straight to <a href="#main">the main scene</a> by talking to Charline, Small Boulangère, after talking to Charles. This is only possible after completing Odilequest for the first time.</p>
<p>Talking to Charline the first time you do the quest just gives her standard dialogue.</p>

<br>

<h3>Talking to Charline before talking to Charles</h3>
<p>(In a second.)</p>

<br>

<h3>After talking to Charles</h3>
<p>(Now.)

<br>

<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> "What about you? Do you know where the book is?"</p>

<br>

<p><b>Small Boulangère:</b> A book?</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> Siffrin, we've just heard they don't have it. Let's go see this Antoine person alrea-</p>
<p><b>Small Boulangère:</b> This is the only book I have!</p>

<br>

<p>(She happily shows off the Paperasse familytale.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (uwah!1):</b> WHAT?</p>
<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> WHAT?</p>
<p><b>Siffrin (fake1):</b> "Oh my!"</p>
<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> ...So you had it, Charline...</p>
<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> Well, I suppose you two can borrow it now.</p>

<br>

<p>(You got the PAPERASSE FAMILYTALE! Finally.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> Siffrin, how did you...</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Odile (awkward1):</b> Nevermind.</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh2):</b> Thank you both. We'll give it back shortly.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Big Boulanger:</b> Take your time.</p>

<br>

<p>(Well, that saved you some time.)</p>

<br>

<br>

<p><b>Beautiful One:</b> Oh... Hello!</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh1):</b> Antoine, is it?</p>
<p><b>Beautiful One:</b> That sure is me. And you're two of the saviors, aren't you...?</p>
<p><b>Beautiful One:</b> Thank you for all you're doing. Best of luck for tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>Odile (question2):</b> ...Thank you. We had a favor to ask...</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> Could we borrow the familytale you possess? For an hour, maybe?</p>
<p><b>Beautiful One:</b> ... Oh, the Paperasse familytale...</p>
<p><b>Beautiful One:</b> . . .</p>
<p><b>Odile (guilty1):</b> ... I know this means a lot to you, so--</p>
<p><b>Beautiful One:</b> Oh, no, that's not the problem, I'd be happy to lend it to you. But, well...</p>
<p><b>Beautiful One:</b> I think one of the kids next door stole it from me?</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>First time:</b> (What.)</li>
  <li><b>Subsequent times:</b> (This would've been so much faster if you asked the daughter beforehand.)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> What.</p>
<p><b>Beautiful One:</b> O-oh, I'm not saying they're bad kids!!! They're very nice kids!!! Very nice!!!</p>
<p><b>Beautiful One:</b> They just. Well. You know the three kids outside?</p>
<p><b>Beautiful One:</b> A few weeks ago, they passed by to help me cook some things, and, well... The book is gone, now.</p>

<br>

<p>(So...)</p>

<br>

<ul>

<p><b>Odile (wonder1):</b> Ah... Hm.</p>

  <li><b>Subsequent times:</b> (You try and act surprised.)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (melan3):</b> Sorry for not saying anything. Isabeau said I must be researching something, since I was a traveler here in Vaugarde...</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan3):</b> And it felt... Easier. To not say anything.</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>First time: Siffrin (surprised1):</b></li>
  <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (sad1):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"So then, why are you..."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (melan5):</b> Why did I leave Ka Bue, travel for years, all to find myself in Vaugarde, if not for some intellectual pursuit?</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> Hm. Well...</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan3):</b> I'm actually here in Vaugarde... To find out more about myself.</p>

<br>

<p>Odile turns away to the right.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (wonder1):</b> ...I suppose it's not very apparent to you, but...</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh1):</b> My mother was Vaugardian.</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>First time:</b> (Oh!)</li>
  <li><b>Subsequent times:</b> (...)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (wonder1):</b> I've lived my whole life in Ka Bue. My father was Ka Buan, and my mother Vaugardian.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan3):</b> I have no idea how they met, he never told me, but all I know is that she never wanted a child.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan5):</b> She left very early in my childhood, and I never saw her again. Good riddance, if you ask me.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan3):</b> But she left, and didn't leave anything behind. No pictures, no letter, no family history.</p>

<br>

<p>Odile looks at Siffrin again.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (huh1):</b> But what does it matter, right? My father was a good man, and Ka Bue was my home.</p>
<p><b>Odile (worried2):</b> I used to think I didn't need to know about my history, about Vaugarde. But still, a part of me was... Curious.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan1):</b> And one day, a few years ago, a Vaugardian merchant showed me her wares. And this book, that she wouldn't let go of.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan4):</b> A book of tales, written by her whole family.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan4):</b> A familytale.</p>

<br>

<p>Odile turns to the right.</p>

<br>

<p>Odile (wonder1): And she explained familytales to me. Generations of Vaugardian parents, writing stories for their children, and writing them down in a book.</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> So you'd end up with stories written by an entire lineage.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> And she was explaining the way the book was written, the rules of this particular way of telling stories...</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> How friendly families shared their stories with each other...</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> And how it had been done for generations, how it brought her closer to her family, her ancestors, her culture.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan5):</b> And while she was explaining all this to me, she suddenly stopped, and I was surprised to find out she stopped because I was crying.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan5):</b> I didn't even realize it.</p>

<br>

<p>Odile turns to Siffrin.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (melan2):</b> Because I wanted this. This connection that she had to a history that was also supposed to be mine.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan6):</b> But it was stolen from me, because my mother left. And I'd never have a link to this culture, ever.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan1):</b> Unless I went there.</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>First time: Siffrin (surprised1):</b></li>
  <li><b>Subsequent times: Siffrin (hide1):</b></li>
</ul>

<p>"So this is why..."</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (melan3):</b> Hm.</p>
<p><b>Odile (urgh1):</b> So I traveled to Vaugarde. And, well, the King took over shortly after I arrived, which did make things more difficult...</p>
<p><b>Odile (wonder1):</b> But during my travels with you all, I got to know many Vaugardians, and see many Vaugardian cities.</p>
<p><b>Odile (wonder1):</b> I got to learn more about the country, its culture, its faith... Its people.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan1):</b> And...</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan2):</b> And I look, and I learn, and...</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan2):</b> This is the country my mother came from, it's half of me, but... But still...</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (melan5):</b> Even now that I'm here in Vaugarde, I feel no connection to it whatsoever.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan5):</b> I don't recognize myself here.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (wry1):</b> Isn't that strange? Half of me should be from here, isn't it? Shouldn't I see something of myself here, in the place that my mother came from?</p>
<p><b>Odile (wry1):</b> Shouldn't it be like looking in a mirror? Like a revelation?</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan5):</b> Shouldn't I see how Vaugardian people act, how they think, and be able to say, "Ah! So this is why I'm like this!"?</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan6):</b> Shouldn't I be able to call this place mine?</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan2):</b> But I can't.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (melan2):</b> And it feels awful, like...</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan6):</b> Like my roots have been cut off without my consent.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan6):</b> Like my mother stole it from me.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan6):</b> Like I really don't belong anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan6):</b> . . .</p>


<br>

<p><b>Odile (lol1):</b> But... This is why I'm here, still.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> To know as much as I can about this country... And in the meantime, find out if it'll make me find out more about myself.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan5):</b> And I did find out more about myself during this journey, so I'm glad.</p>
<p><b>Odile (wonder1):</b> It is an interesting question, is it not? How much do you carry of your country, of a culture that should've been yours, but wasn't?</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh1):</b> It may not seem so to you... But to Ka Bue, my features are foreign.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> Just small things...  My hair being slightly too thick, my brows too thin... Enough for me to look different, here.</p>
<p><b>Odile (dotdotdot2):</b> I am other.</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh2):</b> So... What about Vaugardians? Would they see me as one of theirs? Would I find myself in them?</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan1):</b> After coming here, I found out that no. Of course not. Why would I? I've never been here before this journey.</p>
<p><b>Odile (yeah1):</b> But at the same time, I am not the only one who is other.</p>
<p><b>Odile (yeah1):</b> In fact, Vaugarde is filled with people who also come from other lands.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> Vaugarde welcomes people from all over the world, after all.</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan5):</b> So, even if I did not find someone like me...</p>
<p><b>Odile (yeah1):</b> I have found Vaugarde to be full of people that are similar to me. And I am very grateful for that.</p>

<p>(You don't want to tell her, not anymore. It's yours. It doesn't need to be shared.)</p>
<p>(But... You have to follow the script, still.)</p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 4:</h4>
<p>(You don't want to tell her.)</p>
<p>(You don't want to speak of it.)</p>
<p>(It's gone. Dead and buried. It doesn't exist anymore, not even in your memories.)</p>
<p>(Talking about it makes it real.)</p>
<p>(You don't want to... You don't want to speak of it, but you have to.)</p>
<p>(You have to, because if the Universe made you tell her once, it must want you to tell her every blinding time.)</p>
<p>(The Universe led you here. You can only follow.)</p>

<p><b>Siffrin (hide1):</b> "Trying to find how your roots might have shaped you."</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan1):</b> Which parts of you you created, and which parts already were.</p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 4 only:</h4>
<p>(BUT YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.)</p>

<br>

<p><b>Odile (huh1):</b> ...Siffrin...</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan1):</b> I don't know what you're going through right now. I suppose that even if I asked, you wouldn't answer me, but...</p>

<br>

<p>(...)</p>

<br>

<h4>Always:</h4>

<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> But you know you're not only made of where you're from, right?</p>
<p><b>Odile (gimme1):</b> If that was the case, everyone in Ka Bue would be the exact same, and everyone in Vaugarde would be the exact same...</p>
<p><b>Odile (huh2):</b> Where you're from matters, yes, but it's not the only thing that makes you "you".</p>
<p><b>Odile (melan1):</b> That's what I realized during this journey, Siffrin. I'm Ka Buan and Vaugardian, in ways I do and don't realize...</p>
<p><b>Odile (yeah1):</b> And I am also myself.</p>
<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> One might say that's more important than being Ka Buan and Vaugardian, wouldn't you agree?</p>

<br>

<h4>ACT 4:</h4>
<p>(You don't.)</p>

<p><b>Odile (lol2):</b> Now get out of here! I have a familytale to read before we all meet for our sleepover.</p>

<h4>First time only:</h4>
<p>(You got a MEMORY OF SECRET QUEST!)</p>
<p>(You'll always remember this.)</p>

<br>

<p>[When equipped, Memory of Secret Quest boosts all of your Researcher's stats by 30! Wow!]</p>
<p>[Your Researcher also learned the skill "Craft Break α"!!!]</p>
<p>["Craft Break α" is amazingly strong. When used, it makes an enemy weaker to all CRAFT types for a few turns!!!]</p>
<p>[It's so strong, you'll only be able to use it when you and your Researcher have had this exact conversation. So if you loop back to Dormont, you'll have to talk to her all over again! Remember that, okay?]</p>

<br>

<h4>Subsequent times:</h4>
<p>[Your Researcher learned the skill "Craft Break α" again!!!]</p>

<br>

<h4>Always</h4>
